A quick guide on how to update Post-Processing FX from one version to another.

### 1. Read the Release Notes

WHENEVER there is a new update, read the Release Notes (from the website or the offline file), this will avoid headaches and subsequent questions that are answered in the Release Notes. It contains all the modifications, bug fixes and new features.

Remember: you are not obligated to update Post-Processing FX whenever there is a new version.

Always tell if something broke, after reading all the Release Notes and made some changes (if any) on your own and it still didn't work.

### 2. Back up your PPFX settings

If you have settings to save in the `__ppf_Settings` script, copy it.

### 3. Delete the folder completely

You need to destroy the entire PostProcessingFX folder to avoid any future errors. So, avoid saving any other files to the PostProcessingFX folder.

### 4. Import the new version

Import the new .yymps file.  

### 5. Restore the PPFX settings

Return the `__ppf_Settings` script settings back as they were. Pay attention if there are any new parameters.  

You now have the updated Post-Processing FX version, with awesome new stuff :)
