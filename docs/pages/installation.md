This quick guide will show you how to download and install Post-Processing FX in your project.

### Download the purchased file from store.

Log into your Itch.io or Marketplace account and download the files.

### If purchased from Itch.io:

You received a .yymps and a .yyz file.  
* The **.yymps** file is a "Local Package" file, it will only contain the Post-Processing FX folder alone, without any examples, ready to use in a new or existing game.  
* The **.yyz** file contains the GameMaker project, which will contain the PPFX and all the examples, among others.  

To import the **.yymps** file, go to menu:  
Tools > Import Local Package
