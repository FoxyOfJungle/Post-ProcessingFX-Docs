## Installation Tutorial <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This quick guide will show you how to download and install Post-Processing FX in your project.

### Download the purchased file from store.

Log into your Itch.io account and download the files in your library.

### If purchased from Itch.io:

You received a .yymps and a .yyz file.  
* The **.yymps** file is a "Local Package" file, it will only contain the Post-Processing FX folder alone, without any examples, ready to use in a new or existing game.  
* The **.yyz** file contains the GameMaker project, which will contain the PPFX and all the examples, among others (Release Notes + Readme).  

### To import the **.yymps** file, go to menu:  
**Tools > Import Local Package**  

![YYMPS](/../images/Installation_0.png)

To import the **.yyz** file, go to menu:  
File > Import Project  

![YYZ](/../images/Installation_1.png)

A new window will open, now just do this:

![YYZ](/../images/Installation_3.png)

Done! :) Now it will look like this:

![YYZ](/../images/Installation_2.png)

![YYZ](/../images/Installation_4.png)

</br>

### To import the **.yyz** file, go to menu:  
**File > Import Project**  

This way, you will be able to view examples of using Post-Processing FX.
